# PongMVPShowcase

Start of development 11.06.23.
End of development 23.06.23

I created a basic replica of Pong using Unity 2021 LTS in little more than one week. The project incorporates Model-View-Presenter architecture, dependency injection, and reactive programming. Asset loading is managed using Addressables. To enhance performance, Zenject factories and memory pools are utilized. The user interface was designed with Unity UI and TextMeshPro, while animations were created through tweening.
